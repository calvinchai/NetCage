## Description

NetCage is a user-level network access control tool designed to provide network access restrictions for processes, particularly in environments where you don't have root access or are in incompatible containers. Unlike traditional methods such as iptables or firewalls, NetGuardian offers an alternative approach to ensure your processes remain within defined network parameters.

## Features

- **User-level Control:** No root access required.
- **Container-friendly:** Works seamlessly in a variety of container environments.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource overhead.
- **Custom Rules:** Define specific network access rules per process.
